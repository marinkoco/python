Number guessing game where the program generates a random number, and the player has to guess that number within a certain number of attempts.
The program will generate a random number between 1 and 100. 
You'll be prompted to enter your guesses, and the program will provide feedback on whether your guess was too low or too high. 
Keep guessing until you guess the correct number or reach the maximum number of attempts (which is 10 in this case).
